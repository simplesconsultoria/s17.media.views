Overview
--------

Part of SimplesConsultoria's s17 Plone customization product. Can be used
standalone.

This product will authomatically change the default views of uploaded file
objects (ATFile) if they are multimedia content (like audio or video), so that
a multimedia player (currently flowplayer) is used to view those files.

Mostly Harmless
